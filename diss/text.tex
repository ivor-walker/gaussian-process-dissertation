\title{Comparing Correlation Functions and Exploring Efficiency and Identifiability Issues for the Gaussian Process}

\section*{Abstract}

% This project concerns the Gaussian process. The student will be required to understand the Gaussian process model and the different applications where it is employed, in relation to statistical modelling and machine learning, by reading relevant textbooks and publications. Then, using simulated and real data, different correlation functions will be explored and compared. Other aspects of the Gaussian process (GP) will be explored. Computational efficiency, for instance, as using the GP typically requires the inversion of large matrices, or identifiability issues when the GP is used to model the residuals after a linear model is fitted.
